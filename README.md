## Overview of Project:
The final goal of this project is to colorize black and white images with the help of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. This is an image to image translation task that i implemented with the help of the CGAN model described in <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf>pix2pix Paper</a>.
We are given the COCO image dataset which contains various different images and our task is to use the black and white version of validation images, and produce a colorized version that is decently similar to the original image.

## Data Description:   
As mentioned earlier, i am using COCO images dataset that is fetched with the help a python library called `fastai`.
## Libraries used:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* torch
* torchvision<br>
* PIL
* os module of python
* tqdm
* shutil
* innit?
